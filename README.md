Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Stocks 📊
🔹 What Did We Do in the EDA Process?
1️⃣ Checking Data Quality
Displayed the first 5 rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
2️⃣ Outliers Detection
Used Boxplot to visualize potential outliers.
Applied the IQR Method to detect and handle anomalies.
3️⃣ Analyzing Trends and Price Volatility
Calculated moving averages (50-day & 200-day) to observe short- and long-term trends.
Plotted stock prices with moving averages to visualize general trends.
4️⃣ Feature Correlation Analysis
Used Heatmap to explore relationships between variables such as price, volume, etc.
5️⃣ Time Series Decomposition
Extracted Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals using Time Series Decomposition to analyze stock price behavior.
🎯 Objective of EDA
Gain deeper insights into the dataset before building predictive models.
Improve data quality by handling missing and anomalous values.
Identify key features that influence stock price movements.
📌 This analysis helps in making better decisions when developing models like ARIMA and LSTM for future stock price predictions! 🚀
